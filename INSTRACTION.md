##Full Stack Challenge

Overview
In this challenge you will build an e-commerce system which allows users to search, add items to their shopping cart, create order and checkout successfully.

Given a sample database in MySQL, you will need to implement the backend and frontend (Check out the files at: https://github.com/zandoan/turing-fullstack).

If you are strong in Node and React, please do this challenge in Node and React, since we have maximum customers who want Node+React full stack engineers, and a lot of opportunities to match you quickly for medium to long term projects, if you do exceptional work in this project.

If you are not familiar with one or both of these frameworks, please feel free to use other frameworks/languages (Angular, Vue, PHP, C#, Python, Clojure, etc.). We have fewer customers interested in full stack engineers skilled in these other technologies, but they still exist and we can match you if you do exceptional work in this project.

Any advanced techniques, tools, frameworks used in the code will also give you bonus points. Please add notes in the readme file so we can easily find and evaluate them.

Our customer companies have very high standards for software engineers, so please do your best possible work here, to impress them.
