##Full Stack Challenge

Overview
In this challenge you will build an e-commerce system which allows users to search, add items to their shopping cart, create order and checkout successfully.

Given a sample database in MySQL, you will need to implement the backend and frontend (Check out the files at: https://github.com/zandoan/turing-fullstack).

If you are strong in Node and React, please do this challenge in Node and React, since we have maximum customers who want Node+React full stack engineers, and a lot of opportunities to match you quickly for medium to long term projects, if you do exceptional work in this project.

If you are not familiar with one or both of these frameworks, please feel free to use other frameworks/languages (Angular, Vue, PHP, C#, Python, Clojure, etc.). We have fewer customers interested in full stack engineers skilled in these other technologies, but they still exist and we can match you if you do exceptional work in this project.

Any advanced techniques, tools, frameworks used in the code will also give you bonus points. Please add notes in the readme file so we can easily find and evaluate them.

Our customer companies have very high standards for software engineers, so please do your best possible work here, to impress them.

Functionalities: Work as expected. Precise inputs/outputs. Users can go through flows smoothly. No critical bugs.
System Design: Use the most advanced front-end architecture.
Coding: Clean code. Good coding style. Good comments. Easy to read, debug and add more stuffs.
Testing: You should add test cases for the main functions of the system.
Deployment: Host your solution online and provide the URL
Documentation: Describe the architecture, technologies you use in your documents and readme file.
Source Code: please upload your source code on Github, set it private, invite TuringCom as Collaborator, and send the link to us.
